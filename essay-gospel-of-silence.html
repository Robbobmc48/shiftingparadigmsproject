  The Gospel of Silence: How Religious Abuse Became the First God I Ever Knew

A survivor’s manifesto on coercive control, sexuality, and the nervous system that refused to die for someone else’s righteousness.

The trauma is specific in homes where God is used not as a guide, but as a leash.
It’s a slow, controlling, and oppressive trauma — quiet, sanctified, and fully endorsed by the adults who claim to love you most.
Trauma doesn’t begin with bruises. It begins in the nervous system — in the quiet places where the body holds the impact long before the symptoms surface. Over time, the cost shows up everywhere: the heart, the blood vessels, the gut, the immune system.
It leaves beliefs.
It leaves a nervous system that never stops asking:
“What part of me must die today so I can stay loved and accepted?”

I learned that question in my early teens when religion became the new family addiction, and my sexuality stopped being theoretical and started becoming difficult to hide. Puberty lit every alarm in my mother’s skin the way a siren lights up a prison yard. Suddenly, every inch of my identity became suspect evidence, used to control and traumatize me further. Because in homes like mine, the gay son or daughter is not simply a child — he’s a theological crisis with a pulse.

And crises must be controlled.

The First Layer of Coercion: God as Surveillance

People imagine religious abuse as shouting and brimstone. Mine was quieter, colder, more efficient.
The unspoken message was simple:

“I see everything you are. God sees everything you are. And neither of us approve.”

Religious coercion doesn’t always scream.
Sometimes it just watches.

My mother’s version of Christianity functioned like a psychological panopticon. I eventually didn’t need to be punished — I learned to punish myself preemptively.

This is how coercive control works:

Monitoring – every gesture, interest, relationship and/or friendship becomes data for suspicion.

Moral inversion – obedience becomes righteousness; authenticity becomes rebellion.

Fear conditioning – not of hell, but of relational annihilation and exclusion.

Identity reprogramming – the child becomes a project, not a person.

By 15, I understood the rules:
My body was the battlefield.
My mother and step father were the generals.
God was the surveillance camera installed in my skull.

Some call that “faith.”
Trauma research calls it attachment terror.

The Nervous System Timeline: How the Body Learns to Disappear

Developmental trauma doesn’t begin with visible explosions. It begins with microscopic ones — silent detours in the nervous system that bend a child toward survival.

Ages 0–7: Hypervigilance as Language

When the adults in your world are unpredictable, the nervous system becomes your first translator. You don’t learn words — you learn threat detection.
You learn to read tone, footsteps, the air in the room.
You become fluent in the micro-signals of disapproval long before you understand grammar.

Ages 8–12: Shame Conditioning

This is when the body becomes the problem.
Children targeted for identity-based correction start shaping their personality around shame before they even know what shame is.
Your heartbeat becomes a liability.
Your preferences become evidence.
Your natural impulses become moral hazards.

Ages 13–18: Spiritual Coercion and Identity Collapse

This is where religious abuse hits full force.
Your nervous system is punished simply for existing in the direction of who you are.

The brain learns:
Connection requires self-erasure.
Belonging requires compliance.
Safety requires silence.

This is not “rebellion versus obedience.”
This is trauma physiology — the collapse response used to survive authority.

Adulthood: The Echoes

If you grow up in this system, your body carries the gospel longer than your mind does.

You learn:

People-pleasing as atonement

Emotional shrinking as self-protection

Hypervigilance as social skill

Perfectionism as penance

Dissociation as spiritual discipline

By the time you’re grown, the church isn’t the building — it’s the nervous system you now live inside.

Parents Who Needed a God to Do their Dirty Work

Coercive religious environments don’t happen by accident. They are built by people who need a divine permission slip for their own unresolved terror, shame, and/or control.

My parents didn’t fear God in the way they professed.
They used God — as a megaphone, a shield, a threat, and a justification.
Their faith didn’t come from conviction; it came from convenience.

Religion gave them:

Authority they didn’t really have to earn

Obedience they didn’t have to negotiate

Morality they didn’t have to embody

Power they didn’t have to justify

And I became the canvas on which they attempted to paint their righteousness.

My sexuality was their battlefield because my authenticity threatened their theology more than it threatened any scripture.

Parents like that don’t protect their children —
they protect their worldview from their children.

The Theology of Control: What They’ll Never Say Out Loud

Here is the truth people choke on:

Religious abuse is not about sin.
It is about ownership.
In their minds, just as in early childhood, I was their property, not a human being.

Coercive religion functions like any authoritarian system:

Define the problem

Define the solution

Ensure the child never reaches the solution

Call the failure spiritual growth

Your “brokenness” is their renewable resource.

A gay child in a fundamentalist home is not a soul to be saved —
he is leverage.

The Survivor’s Manifesto: I Will Not Carry Your Gospel in My Body Anymore

I refuse to sanitize this.
I refuse to translate my trauma into polite language for people who’ve never lived it.
I refuse to hide the truth because it makes religious abusers uncomfortable.

So here is my manifesto:

I will not be your cautionary tale, your sin narrative, or your spiritual project.
I will not shrink to fit the theology that tried to strangle me.
I will not carry your shame in my bloodstream like a sacrament.
I will not let your version of God live rent-free in my nervous system.
I will not participate in my own erasure ever, ever again.

You built a gospel of silence.
I am building a gospel of truth.

You built a theology of fear.
I am building a theology of autonomy.

You built a religion where my survival was a sin.
I am building a life where my existence is not negotiable.

To Every Survivor Reading This

If your first god was fear,
if your first scripture was shame,
if your first prayer was “please don’t let them find out,”
if your first confession was forced,
if your first identity was forbidden,
if your first trauma was theological,

you are not beyond repair.
You are not immoral.
You are not defective.
You are not broken.

You are adapted — exquisitely, intelligently, and against impossible odds.

God did not do that to you.
Your abusers did.
And they used His name because theirs wasn’t powerful enough to get the kind of control they were compelled to create and conjure.

Your story does not need to be polite.
Your truth does not need to be softened.
Your survival does not need to be justified.

Tell it anyway.
Tell it loudly.
Tell it for the child who never got to speak.
Tell it for the adult who finally can.

And if people like my parents ever stumble onto this page?
Good.
I must let the truth burn where the lies once lived.
