# Shifting Paradigms Project

A survivor-led, trauma-informed platform created by Robert McDowell, MS.  
This project exposes how childhood chaos, religious coercion, identity suppression, and emotional neglect shape the nervous system and the adult self.

The site features:
- **Essays** on religious abuse, coercive control, trauma psychology, and identity-based harm  
- **Guides and educational content** on nervous-system adaptation, survival patterns, and trauma literacy  
- **A lived-experience perspective** grounded in professional human-services training  
- **Support options** for readers who want to learn, heal, or connect

This repository contains the source code for the Shifting Paradigms website, deployed via Netlify.  
All future updates are managed through this GitHub repo for clarity, stability, and version control.
