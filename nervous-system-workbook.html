        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          This workbook is designed for survivors of complex, developmental, and religious trauma who have been told for years that they
          are “too sensitive,” “too dramatic,” or “the problem.” It translates trauma science into clear, compassionate language so you
          can finally understand what happened to your nervous system and why you respond the way you do.
        </p>
        <p>
          You’ll explore how your body learned to adapt, how identity was shaped under pressure, and how you can begin reclaiming
          agency, dignity, and self-trust without minimizing what you survived.

        <h2>1. What Trauma Really Is</h2>
        <p>
          Trauma is not just about what happened once. It is often about what happened <em>over and over</em> while nobody stepped in
          to protect you. Developmental trauma reshapes the nervous system, teaching your body that safety is conditional, temporary,
          or impossible.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The difference between developmental trauma and single-event trauma</li>
          <li>How chronic invalidation and control wire your nervous system</li>
          <li>Why “shutting down” is a survival reflex, not a character flaw</li>
        </ul>

          <h3>Exercise: The Moment My Body Learned Not to Trust</h3>
          <p>
            Think back to an early memory where something inside you changed. You may not remember exact details, but your body
            remembers the feeling.
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Write down a moment when you realized speaking up, asking for help, or being yourself didn’t feel safe.</li>
            <li>Describe what you <strong>felt in your body</strong> at that time (heart rate, breathing, muscle tension, stomach, etc.).</li>
            <li>Finish this sentence: “From that point on, my body learned that it was safer to ______ than to ______.”</li>
          </ol>
          <p class="note">
            You don’t have to get it “perfect.” This is about noticing how your nervous system adapted, not judging yourself.

        <h2>2. Your Body as Storykeeper</h2>
        <p>
          Even when your mind goes blank or minimizes what happened, your body keeps the score. It reacts to tones, looks, phrases,
          and environments long before you consciously register them.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Hypervigilance as a false alarm system trying to keep you alive</li>
          <li>Dissociation as a brilliant, automatic survival strategy</li>
          <li>How trauma responses are misread as “personality problems”</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="exercise-card">
          <h3>Exercise: Mapping My Body’s First Language</h3>
          <p>
            Use your body as data, not as the enemy.
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>List common situations that make you feel anxious, small, frozen, or on edge.</li>
            <li>For each situation, note where you feel it in your body (throat, chest, stomach, jaw, hands, etc.).</li>
            <li>Next to each sensation, write: “What is my body trying to protect me from right now?”</li>
          </ol>
          <p class="note">
            You are not “overreacting.” Your nervous system is reacting to a lifetime of patterns.

        <h2>3. Identity Under Siege</h2>
        <p>
          When you grow up in environments that police who you are allowed to be—religious, familial, or cultural—your nervous system
          learns that authenticity is dangerous. Shame becomes a control strategy wrapped in “love,” “obedience,” or “holiness.”
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>How shame-based systems hijack identity formation</li>
          <li>The cost of hiding or fragmenting your sexuality, gender, or core self</li>
          <li>Why the loudest voice in your head often isn’t actually yours</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="exercise-card">
          <h3>Exercise: Rewriting the Inner Voice</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Write down three harsh statements you hear in your head on a regular basis.</li>
            <li>For each one, ask: “Who does this sound like?” (A parent, church leader, partner, community?)</li>
            <li>
              Rewrite each sentence in a trauma-informed, supportive voice. For example:  
              <em>“You’re too much” → “You were too much for people who refused to make room for your humanity.”</em>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p class="note">
            Your task is not to “silence” the old voice overnight, but to give your true voice equal airtime.

        <h2>4. Reclaiming Autonomy</h2>
        <p>
          Autonomy is the ability to choose, to say no, to walk away, and to decide who gets access to you. If you were raised in
          control-based systems, autonomy was treated as rebellion instead of health.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Why triggers are old survival programs trying to protect you</li>
          <li>The difference between “safe” and “familiar” (they are not the same)</li>
          <li>How boundaries protect your nervous system, not just your calendar</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="exercise-card">
          <h3>Exercise: My First Act of Safe Rebellion</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Identify one small area where you have been saying “yes” out of fear or obligation.</li>
            <li>Write a script for a small, realistic boundary you can set in that area.</li>
            <li>
              Ask yourself: “What does my body need to feel as safe as possible while I practice this boundary?” (support person, exit
              plan, calming strategy, etc.)
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p class="note">
            Rebellion, in this context, is simply your body reclaiming space it should have always had.

        <h2>5. A New Internal Foundation</h2>
        <p>
          Healing is not about erasing what happened. It is about building a life where your nervous system no longer has to live in
          permanent emergency mode. It is about becoming someone who believes themselves.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Rebuilding self-trust after a lifetime of gaslighting and denial</li>
          <li>Choosing relationships that align with your nervous system’s need for safety</li>
          <li>Creating room for rest, joy, and curiosity without guilt</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="exercise-card">
          <h3>Exercise: My Nervous System Manifesto</h3>
          <p>
            Write a short statement that names what your nervous system deserves from here forward.
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Begin with: “From this point on, my nervous system is no longer required to…” and finish the sentence.</li>
            <li>Add three commitments you are making to yourself (for example: “I will pause before shaming myself,” etc.).</li>
            <li>Keep this somewhere visible. It is not a promise of perfection; it is a declaration of direction.</li>
