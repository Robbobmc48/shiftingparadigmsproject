          I am a <strong>Trauma Literacy Specialist &amp; Peer Support Consultant</strong>.  
          I help survivors of complex and religious trauma understand their nervous system, make sense of their patterns, and begin reclaiming their identity through education, reflection, and survivor-informed support.
        </p>
        <p>
          These services are <strong>non-clinical</strong> and do not replace therapy.  
          They are designed to complement clinical care or stand alone as a space for education, clarity, and grounded support.

        <h3>1:1 Survivor Support Sessions</h3>
        <p>
          These one-on-one sessions are a space to slow down and understand what your body and story have been carrying.
          Together, we explore:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Trauma responses such as fawn, freeze, shutdown, and hypervigilance</li>
          <li>Patterns in relationships that trace back to early abuse, neglect, or spiritual control</li>
          <li>How chronic stress and complex trauma shape the nervous system over time</li>
          <li>How to reframe self-blame into a more accurate understanding of survival</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The goal is not to “fix” you, but to help you <strong>understand yourself</strong> in a way that is accurate, compassionate, and rooted in trauma literacy.

        <h3>Guided Trauma Literacy Sessions</h3>
        <p>
          These sessions focus on the <strong>education</strong> side of healing.  
          If you’ve ever wondered “Why am I like this?” or “Why does my body react this way?”, trauma literacy sessions are for you.
        </p>
        <p>We cover topics such as:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Basic nervous system and polyvagal concepts in plain language</li>
          <li>How chronic chaos and invalidation shape identity and behavior</li>
          <li>Understanding religious trauma and spiritual abuse dynamics</li>
          <li>The difference between personality and survival adaptation</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          You’ll leave with language, concepts, and frameworks that help you interpret your experience without shame.

        <h3>Peer Support Circles &amp; Group Conversations</h3>
        <p>
          These are small group spaces—facilitated via Zoom—where survivors are invited to learn, share, and feel witnessed.
          They are structured around safety, dignity, and clear boundaries.
        </p>
        <p>Group offerings may include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Complex trauma and nervous system education</li>
          <li>Religious and spiritual trauma conversations</li>
          <li>Identity reconstruction after scapegoating or family abuse</li>
          <li>Open Q&amp;A and peer reflection within a contained group</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          My role is to guide the conversation, offer trauma-informed context, and maintain a space where no one is shamed for the ways they survived.

    <h2>The Voice Lab</h2>
    <p class="lead">
      The Voice Lab is a space for self-authorship — where survivors reclaim the words, stories, and inner narratives that trauma forced into silence.
    </p>

    <div class="voice-lab-grid">
      <div class="voice-lab-column">
        <h3>What the Voice Lab Is</h3>
        <p>
          The Voice Lab is a focused space for survivors who have spent years being silenced, misrepresented, or spoken over by family systems, religious communities, or abusive environments.
          It is not about performance. It is about <strong>reclaiming authorship</strong> — slowly, safely, and on your own terms.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the Voice Lab, we explore how trauma:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Conditions you to doubt your own perception and memory</li>
          <li>Trains you to silence yourself to keep the peace or avoid punishment</li>
          <li>Distorts your sense of identity, worth, and belonging</li>
          <li>Turns your voice into something that feels dangerous to use</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Together, we begin to undo that conditioning. The work here is about finding language for what happened, and for who you are beyond what happened.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="voice-lab-column">
        <h3>What Happens in the Voice Lab</h3>
        <p>
          Depending on your needs and capacity, Voice Lab work can include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Guided prompts to help you write or speak your story in manageable pieces</li>
          <li>Reflection on how your nervous system responds when you try to be visible</li>
          <li>Support in separating your authentic voice from internalized family or religious messages</li>
          <li>Gentle experiments in self-expression that respect your pace and boundaries</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          You are never pushed to disclose more than you want to. You are never shamed for freezing, fawning, minimizing, or struggling to find the words. Those patterns are part of the work, not something you are judged for.

      <h3>Webpage-as-Healing-Tool: A Signature Voice Lab Process</h3>
      <p>
        One of the most powerful ways I reclaimed my own voice was by creating a space that was entirely mine — this website. It became more than a project; it became proof that my story and perspective deserved to exist in the world, without editing from the people who had harmed me.
      </p>
      <p>
        Inside the Voice Lab, the <strong>Webpage-as-Healing-Tool</strong> process offers you a similar opportunity. We use the creation of a simple personal webpage as a guided act of self-authorship. This is not about branding or business. It is about <strong>building a home for your voice</strong>.
      </p>

      <div class="voice-lab-grid">
        <div class="voice-lab-column">
          <h4>What This Process Can Include</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Clarifying what you want this space to hold: your story, your values, your boundaries, your creative work</li>
            <li>Mapping a simple structure for your page (for example: About, Story, Reflections, or Resources)</li>
            <li>Finding language that feels honest but not overwhelming to put in each section</li>
            <li>Building the page step by step, with support, using accessible tools</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="voice-lab-column">
          <h4>Why It Matters</h4>
          <p>
            For many survivors, trauma has made self-expression feel unsafe, selfish, or pointless. Creating a webpage that is yours — even if no one else ever sees it — can:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Challenge the belief that your voice is “too much” or “not important”</li>
            <li>Offer a tangible sense of accomplishment in the middle of recovery</li>
            <li>Give structure to a story that has felt fragmented or chaotic</li>
            <li>Demonstrate, in a visible way, that you are allowed to exist in your fullness</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The goal is not a perfect website. The goal is the <strong>experience</strong> of seeing your story, values, and self reflected back to you in a space no one else controls.
          </p>

        <h3>“Start Here” Intake Session</h3>
        <p>
          If you’re unsure where to begin, the <strong>Start Here</strong> intake session is a one-time conversation designed to orient you.
        </p>
        <p>In this session, we will:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Briefly map your trauma landscape without forcing details</li>
          <li>Identify your most pressing concerns and patterns</li>
          <li>Introduce basic nervous-system concepts relevant to your story</li>
          <li>Clarify whether 1:1 support, group circles, or the webpage process is the best next step</li>
          <li>Discuss scope and boundaries so you know exactly what I can and cannot offer</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This session is about <strong>orientation, not obligation</strong>.  
          You decide if and how you’d like to engage further.

        <p>
          Working with me is not about being analyzed or pathologized.  
          It’s about being <strong>understood</strong>.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Collaborative, not hierarchical.</strong> I am not above you; I’m beside you as a fellow survivor with training and language to help make sense of what you’ve lived.</li>
          <li><strong>Education, not diagnosis.</strong> I don’t diagnose or treat mental illness. I offer trauma literacy, psychoeducation, and peer-informed support.</li>
          <li><strong>Choice at every step.</strong> You are free to pause, redirect, or stop any process at any time. Your autonomy is central.</li>
          <li><strong>No forced disclosure.</strong> You will never be pushed to recount details you are not ready to share.</li>
          <li><strong>Respect for your existing supports.</strong> If you’re in therapy or other care, my role is to complement—not replace—those relationships.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          My intention is to offer a space where your nervous system, your story, and your reality are treated with the seriousness they deserve.

            <strong>1. Start Here Intake</strong><br />
            We meet for an initial session to understand your needs, questions, and hopes.  
            We clarify scope, boundaries, and whether this work is a good fit.

          <li>
            <strong>4. Integration &amp; Next Steps</strong><br />

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

        <h4>Are you a therapist?</h4>
        <p>
          No. I am not a therapist and I do not provide psychotherapy or clinical treatment.
          I am a Trauma Literacy Specialist &amp; Peer Support Consultant with a background in Human Services and Certified Peer Support, as well as lived experience with complex and religious trauma.
        </p>

        <h4>How is this different from therapy?</h4>
        <p>
          Therapy focuses on diagnosis and clinical treatment.  
          Our work together focuses on <strong>education, reflection, and survivor-informed support</strong>.  
          I help you understand your patterns, responses, and story; I do not diagnose, prescribe, or provide crisis intervention.
        </p>

        <h4>Can I work with you if I’m already in therapy?</h4>
        <p>
          Yes, as long as your therapist agrees that this is appropriate.  
          Many survivors find that trauma literacy and peer support help them get more out of therapy by giving them language and context for what they’re experiencing.
        </p>

        <h4>Do you work with people in active crisis?</h4>
        <p>
          No. I am not a crisis service.  
          If you are in immediate danger or acute crisis, please contact local emergency services or a trusted crisis support line in your area.
        </p>

        <h4>How do sessions take place?</h4>
        <p>
          Sessions are held online, typically via Zoom.  
          Group circles and workshops are also offered virtually so survivors can join from anywhere.
        </p>

        <h4>Is this right for me?</h4>
        <p>
          This work may be a good fit if you are seeking <strong>understanding</strong>, <strong>language</strong>, and <strong>validation</strong> for your experiences with complex or religious trauma, and you are stable enough to engage in reflective conversations without being thrown into crisis.
