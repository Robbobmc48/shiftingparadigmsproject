          I am a <strong>Trauma Literacy Specialist &amp; Peer Support Consultant</strong>.  
          I help survivors of complex and religious trauma understand their nervous system, make sense of their patterns, and begin reclaiming their identity through education, reflection, and survivor-informed support.
        </p>
        <p>
          These services are <strong>non-clinical</strong> and do not replace therapy.  
          They are designed to complement clinical care or stand alone as a space for education, clarity, and grounded support.

        <h3>1:1 Survivor Support Sessions</h3>
        <p>
          These one-on-one sessions are a space to slow down and understand what your body and story have been carrying.
          Together, we explore:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Trauma responses such as fawn, freeze, shutdown, and hypervigilance</li>
          <li>Patterns in relationships that trace back to early abuse, neglect, or spiritual control</li>
          <li>How chronic stress and complex trauma shape the nervous system over time</li>
          <li>How to reframe self-blame into a more accurate understanding of survival</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The goal is not to “fix” you, but to help you <strong>understand yourself</strong> in a way that is accurate, compassionate, and rooted in trauma literacy.

        <h3>Guided Trauma Literacy Sessions</h3>
        <p>
          These sessions focus on the <strong>education</strong> side of healing.  
          If you’ve ever wondered “Why am I like this?” or “Why does my body react this way?”, trauma literacy sessions are for you.
        </p>
        <p>We cover topics such as:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Basic nervous system and polyvagal concepts in plain language</li>
          <li>How chronic chaos and invalidation shape identity and behavior</li>
          <li>Understanding religious trauma and spiritual abuse dynamics</li>
          <li>The difference between personality and survival adaptation</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          You’ll leave with language, concepts, and frameworks that help you interpret your experience without shame.

        <h3>Peer Support Circles &amp; Group Conversations</h3>
        <p>
          These are small group spaces—facilitated via Zoom—where survivors are invited to learn, share, and feel witnessed.
          They are structured around safety, dignity, and clear boundaries.
        </p>
        <p>Group offerings may include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Complex trauma and nervous system education</li>
          <li>Religious and spiritual trauma conversations</li>
          <li>Identity reconstruction after scapegoating or family abuse</li>
          <li>Open Q&amp;A and peer reflection within a contained group</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          My role is to guide the conversation, offer trauma-informed context, and maintain a space where no one is shamed for the ways they survived.

        <h3>Signature Offering: Webpage-as-Healing Tool</h3>
        <p>
          One of the most powerful tools in my own recovery was creating a space that was entirely mine—a webpage that could not be edited by my abusers, censored by family, or erased by an algorithm.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this signature process, I walk alongside you as you design a simple personal webpage that serves as:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>A place to tell your story in your own words</li>
          <li>A container for your values, boundaries, and reclaimed identity</li>
          <li>A creative outlet that builds a sense of agency and accomplishment</li>
          <li>A private or public “home” for the self you are becoming</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          You don’t need to be “tech savvy.” We move slowly, with support, and keep it simple and meaningful.  
          This is less about the technology and more about the <strong>therapeutic experience of owning your voice</strong>.

        <h3>“Start Here” Intake Session</h3>
        <p>
          If you’re unsure where to begin, the <strong>Start Here</strong> intake session is a one-time conversation designed to orient you.
        </p>
        <p>In this session, we will:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Briefly map your trauma landscape without forcing details</li>
          <li>Identify your most pressing concerns and patterns</li>
          <li>Introduce basic nervous-system concepts relevant to your story</li>
          <li>Clarify whether 1:1 support, group circles, or the webpage process is the best next step</li>
          <li>Discuss scope and boundaries so you know exactly what I can and cannot offer</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This session is about <strong>orientation, not obligation</strong>.  
          You decide if and how you’d like to engage further.

        <h2>What to Expect When You Work With Me</h2>
        <p>
          Working with me is not about being analyzed or pathologized.  
          It’s about being <strong>understood</strong>.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Collaborative, not hierarchical.</strong> I am not above you; I’m beside you as a fellow survivor with training and language to help make sense of what you’ve lived.</li>
          <li><strong>Education, not diagnosis.</strong> I don’t diagnose or treat mental illness. I offer trauma literacy, psychoeducation, and peer-informed support.</li>
          <li><strong>Choice at every step.</strong> You are free to pause, redirect, or stop any process at any time. Your autonomy is central.</li>
          <li><strong>No forced disclosure.</strong> You will never be pushed to recount details you are not ready to share.</li>
          <li><strong>Respect for your existing supports.</strong> If you’re in therapy or other care, my role is to complement—not replace—those relationships.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          My intention is to offer a space where your nervous system, your story, and your reality are treated with the seriousness they deserve.

          <li>
            <strong>1. Start Here Intake</strong><br />
            We meet for an initial session to understand your needs, questions, and hopes.  
            We clarify scope, boundaries, and whether this work is a good fit.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2. Choose Your Path</strong><br />
            Based on your needs, you may continue with 1:1 survivor support, group circles, the webpage-as-healing process, or a combination.

          <li>
            <strong>3. Ongoing Trauma Literacy &amp; Support</strong><br />
            Sessions focus on understanding your patterns, nervous system responses, and identity wounds through education and reflection.

          <li>
            <strong>4. Integration &amp; Next Steps</strong><br />
            As you gain clarity and language, we revisit your goals and determine whether to continue, pause, or shift focus.  
            You remain in charge of the pace and direction.

      <div class="container">
        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

        <h4>Are you a therapist?</h4>
        <p>
          No. I am not a therapist and I do not provide psychotherapy or clinical treatment.
          I am a Trauma Literacy Specialist &amp; Peer Support Consultant with a background in Human Services and Certified Peer Support, as well as lived experience with complex and religious trauma.
        </p>

        <h4>How is this different from therapy?</h4>
        <p>
          Therapy focuses on diagnosis and clinical treatment.  
          Our work together focuses on <strong>education, reflection, and survivor-informed support</strong>.  
          I help you understand your patterns, responses, and story; I do not diagnose, prescribe, or provide crisis intervention.
        </p>

        <h4>Can I work with you if I’m already in therapy?</h4>
        <p>
          Yes, as long as your therapist agrees that this is appropriate.  
          Many survivors find that trauma literacy and peer support help them get more out of therapy by giving them language and context for what they’re experiencing.
        </p>

        <h4>Do you work with people in active crisis?</h4>
        <p>
          No. I am not a crisis service.  
          If you are in immediate danger or acute crisis, please contact local emergency services or a trusted crisis support line in your area.
        </p>

        <h4>How do sessions take place?</h4>
        <p>
          Sessions are held online, typically via Zoom.  
          Group circles and workshops are also offered virtually so survivors can join from anywhere.
        </p>

        <h4>Is this right for me?</h4>
        <p>
          This work may be a good fit if you are seeking <strong>understanding</strong>, <strong>language</strong>, and <strong>validation</strong> for your experiences with complex or religious trauma, and you are stable enough to engage in reflective conversations without being thrown into crisis.
