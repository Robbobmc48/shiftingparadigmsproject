    When God speaks with your abuser’s voice, the damage is not just emotional — it is neurological.
    Spiritual gaslighting hijacks faith to control, rewrite reality, and weaponize your instincts against
    you. The horror is not that God is cruel — it is that cruelty was taught as divine.
  </p>

  <p>
    Spiritual gaslighting does not begin with scripture; it begins with power. It is not loud. It is certain.
    Authority replaces curiosity. Obedience replaces truth. And silence becomes safety.
  </p>

  <p><strong>
    “Your perception is rebellion.”<br>
    “Your emotions are sin.”<br>
    “Your needs are selfish.”<br>
    “Your inner truth is the devil’s voice.”
  </strong></p>

  <p>
    Once this belief is installed, they no longer have to silence you. You silence yourself.
  </p>

  <div class="divider"></div>

  <h2>How Spiritual Gaslighting Works (in the body)</h2>

  <p><strong>1. They redefine your intuition as danger.</strong><br>
    A child’s nervous system is designed to sense threat and inconsistency. Abuse reframes those signals as
    rebellion or sin.
  </p>

  <p>
    Over time, the body stops trusting itself — and hands that authority to the abuser.
  </p>

  <p><strong>2. Suffering becomes proof of righteousness.</strong><br>
    Pain is reframed as growth. Exhaustion becomes devotion. Protest becomes defiance.
  </p>

  <p><strong>3. Disagreement becomes disobedience.</strong><br>
    Boundaries are treated as threats. Needs are treated as attacks.
  </p>

  <p><strong>4. Control is delegated to God.</strong><br>
    “I’m not saying this — God is.” The abuser disappears behind holiness.
  </p>

  <p>
    It is coercion disguised as love.
  </p>

  <p><strong>5. Fear is trained to feel like faith.</strong><br>
    Conviction and terror blur. Obedience replaces selfhood.
  </p>

  <div class="divider"></div>

  <h2>Why This Destroys Identity</h2>

  <p>
    It attacks not just autonomy — but interpretation. Your inner compass is dismantled.
  </p>

  <p>
    When intuition is labeled sin, dependence is inevitable.
  </p>

  <div class="divider"></div>

  <h2>Reclaiming the Voice</h2>

  <p>
    Healing does not require rejecting faith — only rejecting counterfeit authority.
  </p>

  <p><strong>
    You are allowed to trust your body.<br>
    You are allowed to name abuse.<br>
    You are allowed to exist without erasing yourself.
  </strong></p>

  <p>
    Liberation begins when silence ends.
