  <h1>ACE Self-Check (Adverse Childhood Experiences)</h1>
  <p><em>A Shifting Paradigms Project resource — helping you understand what happened to you, not what’s “wrong” with you.</em></p>

  <h2>Before You Begin</h2>
  <p>
    Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) are stressful or harmful experiences that occur before age 18 —
    things like emotional abuse, neglect, witnessing violence, or growing up with caregivers who were
    impaired, unsafe, or unstable.
  </p>
  <p>
    This questionnaire is a <strong>public-health screening tool</strong>, not a diagnosis.
    It was developed to help us understand how early adversity can affect health, behavior,
    and the nervous system over time. Your responses are not a verdict on your worth or potential.
    They are one way of naming what you lived through.
  </p>
  <p>
    If at any point this feels activating, it is okay to pause, take a breath, or stop.
    You are not obligated to finish this in one sitting — or at all.
  </p>

  <h2>How to Use This Self-Check</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Answer each question <strong>Yes</strong> or <strong>No</strong> based on what happened before you turned 18.</li>
    <li>Give yourself <strong>1 point</strong> for every “Yes.”</li>
    <li>Add your points for a total ACE score between <strong>0 and 10</strong>.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This is for your own reflection. You do not have to share your score with anyone unless you choose to.
  </p>

  <h2>Scoring Your ACE Self-Check</h2>
  <p>
    For each question you answered <strong>Yes</strong>, give yourself <strong>1 point</strong>.
    Your ACE score is the total number of “Yes” answers, from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>10</strong>.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>ACE 0–1:</strong> Low measured adversity within this specific tool. It does not mean you had no trauma; it just means fewer events captured by this questionnaire.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>ACE 2–3:</strong> Moderate adversity. People in this range often carry chronic stress responses or “overreactions” that make perfect sense in light of their history.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>ACE 4 or higher:</strong> Research shows a strong correlation between higher ACE scores and increased risk for physical and mental health challenges. This reflects the <em>load</em> your nervous system has carried, not a defect in who you are.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    An ACE score is <strong>context</strong>, not destiny. It describes the conditions you lived through, not your capacity to heal or build something different for yourself.
  </p>

  <h2>If Your Score Feels Heavy</h2>
  <p>
    If your ACE score is high, it is normal to feel grief, anger, numbness, or even relief that there is a name
    for what you went through. You are not overreacting. Your body and mind adapted in ways that helped you get through.
  </p>
  <p>
    You might consider sharing your reflections with a trauma-informed therapist, peer support specialist,
    or support group. You deserve spaces where your history is believed and understood.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you are in immediate distress, thinking about harming yourself, or feel unsafe, please contact local emergency
    services or, in the U.S., the <strong>988 Suicide &amp; Crisis Lifeline</strong>.
