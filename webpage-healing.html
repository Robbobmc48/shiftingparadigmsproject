        <p class="lead">
          Creating this website was not just a technical project for me.  
          It became a turning point in my healing—proof that I could build something that was fully mine, uncensored, and un-editable by the people who harmed me.
        </p>
        <p>
          This signature offering is built around that experience.  
          Together, we use the process of creating a simple personal webpage as a <strong>therapeutic, empowering, and deeply validating</strong> tool.

        <h3>Why a Webpage?</h3>
        <p>
          For many survivors of complex and religious trauma, self-expression has always come with a cost: punishment, ridicule, exclusion, or spiritual threats.
        </p>
        <p>
          Building a webpage—however simple—can become a quiet act of rebellion against that conditioning.  
          It is a space where:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Your story is not interrupted, corrected, or dismissed</li>
          <li>Your values and boundaries can be named clearly</li>
          <li>Your voice is not filtered through anyone else’s agenda</li>
          <li>You have visible proof of your capacity to create and own something</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This process is not about perfection.  
          It’s about <strong>ownership, visibility, and agency</strong>.

        <h3>What We Do Together</h3>
        <p>
          You do not need to be “good with technology” to do this.  
          We move in small, manageable steps.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Clarify Your Intention</strong><br />
            We begin by identifying what this webpage is for: your story, your values, your healing timeline, your creative work, or a mix of all of these.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Design the Structure</strong><br />
            We map out a simple layout—maybe an About section, a Story section, a few reflections, or favorite resources.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Give Language to Your Story</strong><br />
            We work together to find words that feel honest and safe, without forcing disclosure beyond your capacity.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Build the Page</strong><br />
            We use accessible tools to create a clean, simple page. I guide you through the process, step by step.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Reflect on the Experience</strong><br />
            We make space to notice what it brings up: grief, pride, relief, fear, empowerment—and we honor those responses together.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </div>
    </section>

      <div class="container">
        <h3>Is This Right for You?</h3>
        <p>
          This process may be a good fit if:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>You feel silenced, erased, or misrepresented by your family, faith community, or past relationships</li>
          <li>You long for a sense of accomplishment that isn’t dependent on someone else’s approval</li>
          <li>You’re curious about technology but intimidated by it</li>
          <li>You are stable enough to reflect on your story without being thrown into acute crisis</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This is not a replacement for therapy.  
          It is a creative, survivor-informed practice that can complement your healing journey.

        <h3>Next Step</h3>
        <p>
          If this resonates with you, the best place to begin is a <strong>Start Here Intake Session</strong>.  
          We’ll look at where you are, what you’re carrying, and whether this process is the right fit for you at this time.
        </p>
        <p>
          From there, we can map out a plan that respects your pace, your nervous system, and your capacity.
